# About Me

Hi there! I'm a **Research Analyst** at **Zoho Corporation Pvt Ltd** specializing in **AI and Machine Learning**. Since joining in January 2022, I’ve been diving into research, reading papers, and making some contributions, though I’m always looking for ways to make a more impactful mark.

### My Interests
I have a strong passion for the intersection of **biology, machine learning, and artificial intelligence**, with particular focus on **LLMs** and **LLM agents**. My goal is to create models that enhance core capabilities like **memory, planning, reasoning, and tool use**, all while exploring the biological underpinnings that inspire these advancements.

### Skills and Goals
I'm on a journey to master **hardware, software, and operations** as well as **physics, math, and biology**. My aim is to move seamlessly across these fields, conducting research and building practical applications. Here’s a quick snapshot of my recent work and goals:

- **Autoencoder Models** for transaction similarity measurements.
- **Web Development** using the Web Audio API to simulate sound effects.
- **Hackathons** like the UC Berkeley AI Agents Hackathon (Fundamentals track).
- Developing my own **blog website** with a futuristic theme, where I can share insights on **physics, math, biology, psychology, AI, and computer science**.

### Learning Path
In addition to my full-time job, I’m working through foundational series in **C++, math, web development, DSA**, and **CUDA programming**. November's plan includes:

- Building core web elements like **HTTP, Git, and a shell in Python**
- Launching a **personal blog website** with GitHub hosting
- Deepening my **DSA skills in Python** and **LLM development**

### Beyond Work
In my downtime, you might find me playing **chess**, **reading books**, or catching a good **cricket** match.
