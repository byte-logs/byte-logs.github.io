Hello Earthling! I am [Mark Madhukar](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mark-madhukar2215/) an Aprenticeship Trainee at [Zoho Corporation Pvt. Ltd.](https://www.zohocorp.com). I work in a R&D team for the company, doing research on and implementing Machine Learning models.

I joined this company straight out of high school, through their [Zoho Schools](https://www.zohoschools.com/zs-technology) program.

I fell in love with coding 5 years ago, and I haven't looked back since then.
